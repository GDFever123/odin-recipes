        <h1>Gravy</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gravy is a tried and true home rememdy of the plains.
            If you were to eat some of this magic milk sauce you would
            never be sick it again. It cured at least two people of 
            dysentery.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk from a gopher</li>
            <li>Pepper from a pepper jar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What To Do Now</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First take the pepper from the jar and make sure that
                it is indeed pepper.</li>
            <li>Instead of what you were going to do, <em>mix</em> it
            all together in a bowl until it becomes pepper milk</li>
            <li>Heat it in the microwave for three hours</li>
        </ol>
